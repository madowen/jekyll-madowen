<p style="text-align:justify;">
	This time the challenge proposed is a Match 3 game, like Bejeweled made by PopCap, Candy Crush Saga from King, or Frozen Free Fall developed by <a href="http://www.generamobile.com/">Genera Interactive</a> who proposed me this challenge.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
	The objective of the game is quite simple, you have to change a tile by an adjacent (up,down,right or left) in order to get 3 (or more) tiles in a row or column, if there isn't a match of 3, tiles will swap back to their position, else if the match exists, all the tiles in the match will disapear. Then the above tiles will fall to fill the blanks and new ones will be created to fill in the blanks at the top of the board.
